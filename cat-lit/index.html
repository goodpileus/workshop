            ethereal book. one of my favorites of all time... set in a post-post-apocalyptic earth. includes a community of people called Dr. Boots List, who live with large cats and have modeled their society around the cats' demeanors and ways of being. they practice forgetting.

            a bit too stuffy for a book about the philosophy of cats. lacks the sudden playfulness and wild energy. there are some worthwhile illuminations, however, and the book has a nice cover illustration.

            the story <i>Night on the Galactic Railroad</i> was adapted into an animated film in 1965 by Gisaburō Sugii. the film depicts the characters as anthropomorphic cats. this is one of my favorite films.
