        It is used in perfume making and has been written about as an aphrodisiac. It is traditionally associated with good fortune and joy,[where?] and has been popular in bridal bouquets and head wreaths for weddings.[where?] Orange blossom essence is an important component in the making of perfume. <img src="1.jpg" class="left"> The petals of orange blossom can also be made into the delicately scented orange flower water (as an alternative to rose water), a common part of both French cuisine and Middle Eastern cuisine (most often as an ingredient in desserts and baked goods). <img src="2.jpg" class="right"> It's also present in hispanic culinary traditions, with notable examples being Mexican Pan de muerto and Spanish Roscón de Reyes.

        Orange blossom honey (citrus honey) is produced by putting beehives in the citrus groves during blooming period. <img src="3.jpg" class="left"> This also pollinates seeded citrus varieties. Orange blossom honey is highly prized and tastes much like the fruit.

        In Spain, fallen blossoms are dried and then used to make tea and the orange blossom gives its touristic nickname to the Costa del Azahar ("orange-blossom coast"), the Castellon seaboard.

        All citrus trees are angiosperms, belong to the single genus Citrus, and remain almost entirely interfertile. This includes grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, and various other types and hybrids. As the interfertility of oranges and other citrus has produced numerous hybrids and cultivars, and bud mutations have also been selected, citrus taxonomy is fairly controversial, confusing, or inconsistent. The fruit of any citrus tree is considered a hesperidium, a kind of modified berry; it is covered by a rind originated by a rugged thickening of the ovary wall.

        The earliest recorded use of the word in English is from the 13th century and referred to the fruit. The first recorded use of "orange" as a colour name in English was in 1502, in a description of clothing purchased for Margaret Tudor.

          Other sources cite the first recorded use as 1512, in a will now filed with the Public Record Office. It is generally thought that Old French calqued the Italian melarancio ("fruit of the orange tree", with mela "fruit") as pume orenge (with pume "fruit").Although pume orenge is attested earlier than melarancio in available written sources, lexicographers believe that the Italian word is actually older.

          The word ultimately derives from Proto-Dravidian or Tamil நாரம் (nāram). From there the word entered Sanskrit नारङ्ग (nāraṅga or nagrungo), meaning 'orange tree'. The Sanskrit word reached European languages through Persian نارنگ (nārang) and its Arabic derivative نارنج (nāranj).

          The word entered Late Middle English in the 14th century via Old French orenge (in the phrase pomme d'orenge). The French word, in turn, comes from Old Provençal auranja, based on the Arabic word. In several languages, the initial n present in earlier forms of the word dropped off because it may have been mistaken as part of an indefinite article ending in an n sound. In French, for example, une norenge may have been heard as une orenge. This linguistic change is called juncture loss. The color was named after the fruit,[28] and the first recorded use of orange as a color name in English was in 1512.
