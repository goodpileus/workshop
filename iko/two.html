        It is used in perfume making and has been written about as an aphrodisiac. It is traditionally associated with good fortune and joy,[where?] and has been popular in bridal bouquets and head wreaths for weddings.[where?] Orange blossom essence is an important component in the making of perfume. <img src="1.jpg" class="left"> The petals of orange blossom can also be made into the delicately scented orange flower water (as an alternative to rose water), a common part of both French cuisine and Middle Eastern cuisine (most often as an ingredient in desserts and baked goods). <img src="2.jpg" class="right"> It's also present in hispanic culinary traditions, with notable examples being Mexican Pan de muerto and Spanish Rosc√≥n de Reyes.

        Orange blossom honey (citrus honey) is produced by putting beehives in the citrus groves during blooming period. <img src="3.jpg"> This also pollinates seeded citrus varieties. Orange blossom honey is highly prized and tastes much like the fruit.

        All citrus trees are angiosperms, belong to the single genus Citrus, and remain almost entirely interfertile. This includes grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, and various other types and hybrids. As the interfertility of oranges and other citrus has produced numerous hybrids and cultivars, and bud mutations have also been selected, citrus taxonomy is fairly controversial, confusing, or inconsistent. The fruit of any citrus tree is considered a hesperidium, a kind of modified berry; it is covered by a rind originated by a rugged thickening of the ovary wall.
