    <p class="words">When children approach artwork created by adults, they are expected to look, not touch. What if instead, they were allowed to play with and even transform what they saw? What if they didn’t realize the material they were engaging with was intended as “art?”</p>

    <p class="words">The Opening is a series of play actions and documentary films that result from collaborations between artist Corin Hewitt, other artists, youth, and community partners. These play actions begin with a chosen site, a group of youth,  and “provocations” by invited artists. Youth playing and recording video in these sites are set loose to play freely, with trained playworkers playing supporting roles. Each of these projects explores the relationship, or lack thereof, between children and artists provocations embedded within each of the sequential sites. Play acts as a form of undirected "processing" of adult artwork as part of the larger cycles of play among children. After a site and a group of youth are identified for each play action, artists are invited to make works or interventions for the site that exist unannounced amongst other materials as children freely play and manipulate all the materials on the site as they choose. The provocations contributed by the artists are just some of the loose parts that youth can freely transform, ignore, or destroy. The editing of the resulting documentary films is a process that starts with the youth who wear the cameras that record the footage.</p>
        
    <p class="words">The documentary films examine the relationship, or lack thereof, between the children and the artist's provocations via footage edited from cameras worn by children who choose to record their play. Each of the films explores the children's engagement, both focused and peripheral, with the rotating artworks made by invited artists. As films are completed, they will be screened (in part) on this website and available for exhibition.</p>
